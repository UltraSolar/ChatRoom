# ChatRoom
Java-based chat room with local or public servers using socket programming 
1) Compile and run the Server file first (to run it on the local network, use the default IP address)
2) Compile and run the Client file
3) Type your username and start chatting
4) users have commands like "/nick" to change their nickname and "/quit" to quit the chat.
It utilizes a thread pool for the server and all the elements and is designed to support multiple clients.
The coding is very simple to understand and can be easily upgraded in the future for additional features.
